# Project Decisions Log - Go Development

> "Talk is cheap. Show me the code." -- Linus Torvalds

**Purpose:** Architectural and design decisions with rationale.
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-29
**Total Decisions:** 0

---

## TL;DR

- Decisions made during development with full context
- Includes alternatives considered and trade-offs
- Searchable for future reference
- Prevents re-debating settled decisions
